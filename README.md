### Introduction
These implementations of popular deep reinforcement learning algorithms are meant to be as simple as possible.  It should be good for really learning and understanding the essence of the algorithm without getting bogged down in extraneous details.  Feel free to use it as a working baseline and extend it to suit your needs.

It is a modern implementation that uses PyTorch 1.0 and python 3.6.


### Environments
All examples use the OpenAI gym CartPole-v0 environment because it is a simple one that converges relatively quickly.  It's a good first step when testing any new RL algorithm.


### Algorithms
The following algorithms have been implemented:
- DQN
- REINFORCE
- REINFORCE multiprocessing
